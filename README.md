# OptiFlow
OptiFlow is a generalised spatio-temporal network optimisation model, 
deterministic, with partial equilibrium, and built upon a bottom-up approach. 
OptiFlow allows modelling of networks with a flexible spatial and temporal resolution, 
which is becoming increasingly important in systems with high shares of generation 
from variable renewable energy sources and locally distributed production and consumption. 
OptiFlow is coded in GAMS.

OptiFlow may be used as a stand-alone model or as hard-linked with Balmorel.

The OptiFlow code is available under the ISC license.
